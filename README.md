the purpose of this project was to update the webstie for Dana so that the user can filter by 4 additional catergories and it would update without having to clock a button.

using these 5 input boxes the user can choose to filter by date, city, state, country, shape in any combination they want just py typing in the boxes they want to filter and the table will upade to match the criteria automatically. This makes it way easier to find the exact data you need.

here is an example of how you would filter if you only wanted results from 1/2/2010 from California.

## Summary
one downside of this design is that it could be time consuming if you need to filter by multiple criteria multiple times. 2 potential good changes to make would be to let the user sort by duration as well and search for specific words in the comments.
